/*
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:


int main()
{
    while (condition )
    {
        code
        change
    }

}


When a certain condition is met, a block of code can be executed by a loop.


Loops are useful because they speed up programming, lower mistake rates, and improve readability.
